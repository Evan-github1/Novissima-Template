These two classes are designed to optimize making macros for our robot.

To create a new macro:
    1. Create a new MacroManager object in your TeleOp class with your current gamepad as an argument
    2. Define the macro using anonymous classes by overriding the defineMacro() method. For every movement,
    write queue.add(() -> yourMethod());
    3. Use the .start() method to begin the macro. The macro will stop whenever a player moves the robot again.
    4. Make sure the running variable is false through the boolean !.isRunning().
    5. Add the .runNext() method at the bottom of your while(opModeIsActive()) loop.
