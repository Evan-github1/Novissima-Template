    1. Make sure you have enough room. By default, the robot moves 48 inches forward,

    Typically larger numbers yield better results.
    2. Then, in the Tuning OpMode, under automatic, select and start Forward Velocity Tuner.
    The robot speed should ramp up until it reaches full power.
    It will continue moving until it has reached the set distance, then it will abruptly stop.
    3. Once the robot stops moving at maximum speed, one number will be displayed on telemetry:
    Velocity: The final velocity the robot achieved before stopping; this is what we want

    1. Same set-up with the x-velocity. By default, the robot moves 48 inches to the left,
    but this can be changed by navigating to the LateralVelocityTuner class in Tuning.java.
    2. In the Tuning OpMode, under automatic, select and start Lateral Velocity Tuner.
    It does the same thing as the x-velocity tuner, but it moves left instead of forward.

    section of Panels Configurables to ensure that the robot can accurately correct back to its starting position with minimal oscillations.

    kP changes are harder to notice. However, tune kP as high as possible
    to maximize holding strength and accuracy, without jittering the robot.
    If you want smoother or sooner deceleration, try experimenting with kP of 0.05 or lower
    and increasing the kQuadratic term, as this will act more like a motion profile.

    Also, lower the parametric end constraint to around .97 or .95. Lower values
    will make actions trigger earlier:
        path.setTValueConstraint(double set)
    Don't set it below .9, though.
